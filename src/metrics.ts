 *   - framework/sol-worker/lib/worker.ml:84-89 (sol_worker_messages_total /
 *     sol_worker_message_duration_seconds, status labels at lines 99,150,
 *     144,and the retry path)
 *   - framework/kafka-eio-service/lib/kafka_service_intf.ml:96-102
 *     (sol_worker_decode_errors_total -- zero labels, a separate counter,
 *     not a "status" value on sol_worker_messages_total)
 *   - framework/sol-svc/lib/service.ml:216-227,256,274 (sol_svc_requests_total /
 *     sol_svc_request_duration_seconds, the "unmatched" route default at
 *     service.ml:113-114,256)

 * FEAT-033's first draft invented "decode_error"/"db_error" status values
 * here; both were wrong for different reasons -- decode errors belong on the
 * separate counter, and a downstream DB failure is exactly what the "retry"
 * status is for.
 *
 * FEAT-076/078 added `dead_letter`, `relay_published` and `relay_failed`
 * (worker.ml, `Retry_topics` only): `retry` counts a record for which a retry
 * was *scheduled*, while `relay_published`/`relay_failed` count whether the
 * relay's own publish of it actually landed. A cross-language dashboard must
 * include them, or a TS worker's retry/DLQ outcomes go uncounted.
