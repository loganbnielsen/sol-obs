 * OCaml sol-worker/sol-svc and a TypeScript one land in the same Grafana
 * panel without disagreeing on label vocabulary:
 *   - framework/sol-worker/lib/worker.ml:84-89 (sol_worker_messages_total /
 *     sol_worker_message_duration_seconds, status labels at lines 99,150,
 *     144,and the retry path)
 *   - framework/kafka-eio-service/lib/kafka_service_intf.ml:96-102
 *     (sol_worker_decode_errors_total -- zero labels, a separate counter,
 *     not a "status" value on sol_worker_messages_total)
 *   - framework/sol-svc/lib/service.ml:216-227,256,274 (sol_svc_requests_total /
 *     sol_svc_request_duration_seconds, the "unmatched" route default at
 *     service.ml:113-114,256)
